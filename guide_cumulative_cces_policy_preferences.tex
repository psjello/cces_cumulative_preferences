\end{quote}

Each year, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) asks
respondents about their preferences on issues like abortion,
immigration, the environment and more. However, variable names for
question items often change from year to year.

\medskip
The \textbf{Cumulative CCES Policy Preferences} data set compiles
various policy preference question items from CCES respondents over
time. This represents an effort to track, rename, recode, and append
together responses to 43 policy preference question items from
individual CCES survey data sets ranging from 2006 to 2019. The
resulting time series is
\href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OSXDQO}{available
in an 89 MB data set}. This data set can be combined with demographic
and political information of each respondent from the
\href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/II2DB6}{Cumulative
CCES Common Content} by merging on the \texttt{case\_id} and
\texttt{year} variables.

\medskip
This guide provides details on each policy preference question item,
including the years where an item appears, frequency tables for response
values, and it's unique, year-specific variable name and question
wording.

\section{Usage warnings}\label{usage-warnings}

R users are advised to download and use the .dta version of the data
set, as the .tab version replaces informative value labels with numbers.
To use .dta files in R, install and load the package ``haven'' via the
following lines of code:
\texttt{install.packages("haven");\ library(haven)}.

\medskip
Some question wording varies slightly across time, with more extreme
changes warranting a note at the end of each question item's section.
Further, some item response values are shortened and/or slightly
re-worded from their original values out of convenience. When shortening
and re-wording occurs, the original value wording is listed inside the
item's respective question wording table.

\medskip
Users of the Cumulative CCES Policy Preferences dataset are encouraged
to reference this guide to examine details on any interested question
item before use.
